  <p>Sharks are some of the most interesting creatures living throughout the ocean. They are among the largest creatures swimming in the sea, but even though they do not look like it they are actually classified as group of fish that are characterized by their cartilaginous skeletons.
      The earliest sharks are known to have existed more than 420 million years ago and since then have diversified into over 500 vastly different species. Many people think of sharks as great, big animals but they can vary in size from something as small as a dwarf lantern shark, which
      can fit into the palm of an average human hand, to as big as a whale shark that can grow up to forty feet in length.</p>

<h3>Shark Teeth</h3>
  <p>Sharks have been around now for over 420 million years, but their bodies are composed of cartilage not bone, so how do we know so much about ancient sharks? The answer is sharks teeth. The cartilage of sharks typically breaks down and disintegrates into the sand making it very rare to find.
    But since sharks shed thousands of teeth in their lifetime and they fossilize much easier, the teeth are a much better source for learning more about sharks.  Fossil sharks teeth are able to tell scientist an astonishing amount of information about prehistoric sharks. Just by studying their teeth, one can figure out where the shark lived, what their diet was, and about how big they were.
    For example, a recent discovery from studying sharks teeth show that sharks may have been able to adapt to climate change. Shark teeth dating back to 40 million years ago were found in an area that was relatively warm and had freshwater, whereas the relatives of these sharks today prefer only saltwater.</p>

  <h3>Endangered Sharks</h3>
    <p>While many people are afraid of sharks and are worried about Shark attacks, what many of them do not know is that sharks are more scared of humans. There are very few threats to sharks in the ocean, some of these are orcas and larger sharks. But one of the real threats is human interaction with sharks.
      Sharks are sometimes mistakenly caught in fishing nets and other times they are intentionally hunted for their jaws and fins. Sharks are the main predator in the ocean and play an important role at the top of the food chain, while many sharks are abundant throughout the ocean, there are still some that are endangered and could possibly face extinction.</p>
